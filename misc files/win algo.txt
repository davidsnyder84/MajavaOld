TENPAIS:
interesting info:
you can only ron if you are in tenpai (you were in tenpai before the tile was discarded)
you can only ron during another player's turn
you can only tsumo if you are in tenpai (you were in tenpai before you drew the tile)
you can only tsumo during your turn

going from "no-ten" to "tenpai" can happen when:
	player perspective:
	//you draw a tile at the beginning of your turn
	//you draw a bonus tile after making a kan during your turn
	you discard a tile during your turn
	you make an ankan
	you make complete a minkan
	
	hand perspective:
	when a tile is removed

if it is possible to win on a tile, tenpai will always be true
exception: tenhou bypasses tenpai. solution: check for tenpai at beginning of game (before starting turns)

	end if
