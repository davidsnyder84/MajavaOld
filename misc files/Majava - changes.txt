-added hot tile check
-added canMakeXCall functions that check if a tile can be chiLMH/pon/kan'd
-now prompts player when a call can be made, and tells them which calls are possible

2013-10-12
-modified canMakeXCall check functions to store partner indices in an array (5 diff arrays)
-hand now stores callCandidate as tile (along with partner index arrays)
-finally added ability to make melds (uses previously stored callCandidate and partner index arrays)
-added nextTile function to tile, for use with dora indicators
-updated documentation

2013-10-13
-wrote a fucntion that returns a list of all possible callable tiles for a hand (where do I use this lol)
-made it so you can only call chi on a tile from your kamicha
-added pauses after discards/calls for dramatic effect
-fixed wall drawing at beginning of game (non-East players weren't drawing on their first turn)
-kan draw seems to be working fine

2013-10-14
-restructured __canChi to be more concise
-restructured __canPon, __canKan, and countHowManyInHand. __storePartnerIndices is explicitly called when it is needed
-added __canPair function and corresponding flag/list. does not affect "isCallableTile" return value
-added copy constructors to Hand and Meld
-changed Tile's compareTo function so that Red 5's come after non-red 5's
-added isHonor() and isTerminal() boolean methods to Tile
